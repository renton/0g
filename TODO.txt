- Sprite TransformationsRotation/Flip
- entity state managment (logic not animation/sprite) (can set the sprite x,y,h,w there? For offsets?)
- Each Sprite returned from get_sprites_to_draw needs to have itâ€™s own x,y,h,w

- better rendering (only draw what is in view)
- colour constants
- better config/constant naming/hierachy
- tool tileset viewer - tiles not loading correct number
- load map from file
- reduce imports (can use configs from game instance?)
- float entity CCD
- Tile/Sprite better organizing
- MapEntity should be a mixin, so a custom entity might inherit from Entity and MapEntity
- Animated should be a mixin, so it can be used with grid entity
- animation data file
- Entity tile check is still rect->rect (needs to be circle->rect clamping)
- (Entity to tile circle to square)
- Tile loading freeze bug?? async loading?
- label widget bind to a var
