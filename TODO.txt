- Each Sprite returned from get_sprites_to_draw needs to have it’s own x,y,h,w

- better rendering (only draw what is in view)
- colour constants
- better config/constant naming/hierachy
- tool tileset viewer - tiles not loading correct number
- load map from file
- reduce imports (can use configs from game instance?)
- float entity CCD
- Tile/Sprite better organizing
- MapEntity should be a mixin, so a custom entity might inherit from Entity and MapEntity
- Animated should be a mixin, so it can be used with grid entity
- animation data file
- Entity tile check is still rect->rect (needs to be circle->rect clamping)
- (Entity to tile circle to square)
- Tile loading freeze bug?? async loading?
- set alpha
- widget parameters
- CCD - keep trying one step until you hit.
    - Step by 1 until first hit
    - What about fast moving? Need to figure out ‘where’ it would be after step
    - Get tile at collision point then figure out its x+y
- Animation offsets - how to test + get right?
- Turn off set smooth
- Title screen - credit screen
- fading/trails/ghost
- Tile colour changing?
- Bullet shockwave mechanics
- Debug screen on/off
- Pygame - separate map + camera (zoom?)
- Options screen:
    - Sound volume
    - Music volume
- Output to binary
