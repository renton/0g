- better rendering (only draw what is in view)
- colour constants
- better config/constant naming/hierachy
- tool tileset viewer - tiles not loading correct number
- load map from file
- reduce imports (can use configs from game instance?)
- float entity CCD
- MapEntity should be a mixin, so a custom entity might inherit from Entity and MapEntity
- Tile/Sprite better organizing
- animated mixin
- entity state managment (logic not animation/sprite)
