:0g:
- Animation offsets - how to test + get right?
- Death state
- Output to binary
- Tile loading freeze bug?? async loading?

:TODO:
- audio channel management
- float entity CCD
    - CCD - keep trying one step until you hit.
    - Step by 1 until first hit
    - What about fast moving? Need to figure out ‘where’ it would be after step
    - Get tile at collision point then figure out its x+y (instead of using the last known x+y)
- widget parameters - more flexible
- Entity tile check is still rect->rect (needs to be circle->rect clamping)
- Pygame - separate map + camera (zoom?)
- Tile colour changing?
- animation data file
- Tile/Sprite better organizing
- Each Sprite returned from get_sprites_to_draw needs to have it’s own x,y,h,w
    - fading/trails/ghost (- set alpha)
- colour constants
- better rendering (only draw what is in view)
- better config/constant naming/hierachy
- tool tileset viewer - tiles not loading correct number
- load map from file
- reduce imports (can use configs from game instance?)
- MapEntity should be a mixin, so a custom entity might inherit from Entity and MapEntity
- Animated should be a mixin, so it can be used with grid entity

:RL:
